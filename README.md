# PDaS and S24 Spatial Mapping Project

## Project Description

The PDaS and S24 Spatial Mapping project was designed to utilise advanced spatial analytics in  improving STWâ€™s understanding of the location of S24 shared drains and PDaS assets and their key  attributes, i.e., length, material, diameter and yearlaid. Arcadis Gen was tasked with generating a set of  inferred PDaS and S24 assets and their neighbouring proxy sewer mains.

- **Phase 1:** This involved generating property polygons and notional connections from the centroid of the property to the nearest sewer mains. This also involved building custom machine learning models used to assign attributes to notional assets as well as applying Monte Carlo and Latin hyper cube simulations to recalibrate notional asset coefficients. The scripts and repeatable processes were written in R and QGIS.
- **Phase 2:** This involved spatial refinement of the notional length from Phase 1. Using rules and assumptions provided by subject matter experts, the notional connections were upgraded to actual pipe polygons to take into account a wider variety of externalities and engineering constraints.
